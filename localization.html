            <h1>Localization Strategy for eCommerce System</h1>
            <p>Based on our background in current project development, <strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 164);">I recommend that we adopt Lokalise and/or 3rd party localization service</strong> for managing our localization requirements as we expand into new countries.</p>

            <h2>3 Factors in Project Development</h2>
            <p>Considering the three factors of our project development:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost</strong>: The budget and resources required for the project.</li>
                <li><strong>Time</strong>: The timeline or schedule for completing the project.</li>
                <li><strong>Scope</strong>: The specific goals, deliverables, and tasks that the project aims to achieve.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Given our small team size and the urgency to expand into other countries, we currently lack the time and resources to develop our own localization system. Additionally, we're not entirely sure about the full scope of our localization needs at this stage.</p>
            
            <h2>Benefits of Using Lokalise</h2>
            <p>Therefore, using <strong>Lokalise</strong> is a great choice for us right now. It allows us to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Save Time</strong>: Implement localization quickly without extensive development.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduce Costs</strong>: Avoid the expenses associated with building and maintaining an in-house system.</li>
                <li><strong>Manage Uncertain Scope</strong>: Utilize a flexible platform that can adapt as our needs become clearer.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Future Considerations</h2>
            <p>Once we've stabilized our operations, clearly defined the scope of our requirements, and potentially expanded our team after launch, <strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 164);">it would be an appropriate time to consider developing our own system.</strong> At that point, we'll have the resources and clarity needed to create a customized solution that perfectly fits our needs.</p>
            <p><strong>Post-Launch Evaluation</strong>: Once we have launched and stabilized in new markets, we will have a clearer understanding of our localization needs.</p>
            <h3>Potential for In-House Development</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Expanded Team</strong>: With a larger team and more resources, we can consider developing a custom localization system tailored to our specific requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Defined Scope</strong>: A better-defined scope will allow us to build a system that addresses all our needs without unnecessary features.</li>
            </ul>
