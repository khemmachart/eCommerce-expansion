            <p>Before we dive into the details, I'd like to provide some background and goals to ensure we're on the same context.</p>
            <h1>Setup: Background</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>You are a software engineer at a start-up e-commerce company that is expanding into a new country.</li>
                <li>After discussing regulations and strategy, we have decided to establish a separate entity for our new marketplace. This means the engineering team will need to create a new website and mobile applications for this new entity.</li>
                <li>Your role is to propose a new design and process for the team to ensure efficient mobile development, as the team will need to manage multiple applications simultaneously.</li>
                <li>The project is currently being maintained by a small team.</li>
                <li>The project includes the following features: product browsing, search, product details, add to cart, checkout, payment, and order details.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Setup: Business Goals</h1>
            <h2>1. Freelance Online Marketplace → is an eCommerce</h2>
            <p><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 164);">Our platform sells digital services instead of physical goods.</strong> Freelancers (service providers) create products/services, and clients (buyers) purchase these services. The platform handles transactions, payments, reviews, and delivery <strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 164);">just like an eCommerce system</strong>.</p>

            <h2>2. Create a <strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 164);">new website/mobile applications for the new entities</strong></h2>
            <p>Project structure needs to be scalable to expand to new countries <strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 164);">with minimum effort based on small team sizing.</strong> It should be easy to manage the following aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Localization / Cultural Sensitivity</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Legal and Regulatory Compliance</strong> (e.g., registration, identity verification, payment reception)</li>
                <li><strong>Content Marketing</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>GEO-targeting</li>
                        <li>GEO Search Optimization</li>
                        <li>Improving country-specific job search accuracy, such as services based on specific locations like Bangkok</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pricing Strategy</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Localized Pricing → <strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 164);">Users should be able to see prices in that currency based on their location</strong></li>
                        <li>Promotions and Discounts</li>
                        <li><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 164);">Currency Hedging — Protecting investments from unexpected changes in currency exchange rates</strong></li>
                        <li>Payment gateway, fee</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Partnerships and Alliances</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Local Partnerships, e.g., Influencers for Marketing</li>
                        <li>Compliance Assistance</li>
                        <li>Payment Providers</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Time Zone Differences</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Using the same Thai freelancers (Same freelance pool)</h2>

                <li>Focused Resource Allocation — Improving the skills of existing freelancers and marketing to international clients rather than managing a diverse global workforce ✅</li>
            </ul>
